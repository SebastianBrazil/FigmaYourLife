Figma Your Life

This is a website that tells the life of a fictional character from the video game "Baldur's Gate III". There are three working pages that lead to the background, interests, and accomplishments of the character.

10-23-23: Creation of the Figma, showing the design of the website. 
~10-24-23: Built the framework of the website with its navigation bar, colour pallet, text, and images. 
~10-25-23: Organized the images and text to be the same as the Figma, imported fonts and finalized the website.

I like Tav. Tav is very cool.
Very interesting website design, I like the colors and the placement of the images, the text is extremely big though so it might be kinda hard to read
Your toolbar works well
Also, watch out for the naming of your folder before you submit it, it's not like the submission guidelines
